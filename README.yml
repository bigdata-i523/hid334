        Executives are constantly looking for ways to find the  pulse of their
        competitive landscape along with ways to  gauge the sentiment among
        their customers. The emergence of  the Big Data movement has
        given businesses the unique  opportunity to gain perspective on
        these fronts, in  addition to many others. Amazon Web Services has
        placed  itself at the epicenter of this data movement and now
        offers tools that allows decision makers to quantify their businesses
        in ways that were previously computationally impossible
        or were  prohibitively expensive. As a result,  with Amazon
        Web Services, companies now have the ability to
        gain deep insights into customer activity, which can be used
        as real-time feedback or guidance to make future
        experiences more personalized.

    title: The Intersection of Big Data and IoT
    abstract: >
        Big Data and IoT share a symbiotic relationship with one another
        that is leading to incredible innovations that were inconceivable
        just 15 years ago. As a result of this relationship, it has
        become easier than ever for individuals to customize and monitor
        various elements of their life if they choose to do so. A project
        is undertaken to demonstrate how accessible IoT has become to
        leverage Big Data analysis, how IoT and Big Data are being utilized
        together in some of the most interesting current use cases and how
        the technology will need to adapt in coming years.
